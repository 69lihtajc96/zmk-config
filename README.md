# ZMK Configuration for 69lihtajc96

Welcome to my personal ZMK firmware configuration repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repo, hosted at [https://github.com/69lihtajc96/zmk-config](https://github.com/69lihtajc96/zmk-config), contains a custom setup for my keyboard, optimized for efficiency and convenience. Built on the open-source ZMK Firmware (licensed under MIT), this configuration allows me to tailor my keymap, macros, and combos to suit my workflow. Whether you're here to explore, fork, or contribute, letâ€™s dive into the details! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository defines a custom keymap and behavior configuration for my ZMK-based keyboard. It includes:
- **Multiple Layers**: Letters, numbers, symbols, function keys, and a manager layer for toggling.
- **Combos**: Quick shortcuts for launching applications like YouTube and social media platforms.
- **Macros**: Automated key sequences for streamlined actions.
- **Custom Keybindings**: Tailored to my daily use, with support for modifiers and special functions.

ZMK Firmware is a modern, wireless keyboard firmware built on the Zephyr RTOS, designed for flexibility and ease of use. This config leverages its power to create a personalized typing experience without needing a complex toolchainâ€”thanks to GitHub Actions for automated builds!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A GitHub account.
- A ZMK-compatible keyboard (e.g., nice!nano or similar).
- Basic knowledge of Git for cloning and pushing changes.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Fork this Repository**:
   - Click the "Fork" button on the top right of this GitHub page to create your own copy.
2. **Clone the Repo**:
   - Run `git clone https://github.com/69lihtajc96/zmk-config.git` in your terminal.
3. **Configure Your Keyboard**:
   - Edit the `keymap` and `combos` sections in the `.dtsi` file (details below) to match your hardware (board and shield).
   - Update the `build.yaml` file with your target keyboard if needed.
4. **Build the Firmware**:
   - Push your changes to your forked repo. GitHub Actions will automatically build the firmware.
   - Check the "Actions" tab, download the `.uf2` file from the latest build, and flash it to your keyboard by double-clicking the reset button to enter bootloader mode, then dragging the `.uf2` file onto the device.
5. **Test and Customize**:
   - Test the keymap and adjust as needed. Submit a pull request if youâ€™d like to contribute back!

## Key Features

### Layers
This configuration includes multiple layers for different use cases:

- **Letters (Base Layer)**:
  - Standard QWERTY layout with modifiers (Ctrl, Shift, GUI, Alt).
  - Accesses numbers and symbols via layer switches (e.g., `MO(1)` for numbers, `MO(2)` for symbols).

- **Numbers Layer (Layer 1)**:
  - Maps 1-0, arrow keys, and Bluetooth controls (e.g., `BT1`-`BT5`).
  - Activated with `MO(1)`.

- **Symbols Layer (Layer 2)**:
  - Includes special characters (!, @, #, etc.) and additional symbols.
  - Activated with `MO(2)`.

- **Function Keys Layer (Layer 3)**:
  - Maps F1-F12 keys for quick access.
  - Activated with `MO(3)`.

- **Functionality Layer (Layer 4)**:
  - Includes utility keys like Print Screen, Delete, and Calculator.
  - Toggled with `TOG(4)`.

- **Layer Manager Layer (Layer 5)**:
  - Allows toggling layers 4 and 5.
  - Activated with `MO(5)`.

### Combos
Combos are multi-key shortcuts that trigger specific actions. Here are the defined combos:

| **Combo Name** | **Key Positions** | **Action**          | **Layer** | **Timeout (ms)** |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|------------------|
| `YouTube`      | 7, 9, 4, 2        | Launches YouTube    | 0         | 2                |
| `Social`       | 19, 21, 14, 16    | Launches Social Apps| 0         | Not specified    |

- **Key Positions**: Refer to the matrix positions in the `keymap` (e.g., 7 = Y, 9 = U, 4 = E, 2 = W for YouTube).
- **How to Use**: Press the four keys simultaneously (or within the timeout) to trigger the macro.

### Macros
Macros automate complex key sequences. Here are the defined macros:

| **Macro Name**  | **Sequence**                                                                 | **Label**      | **Wait (ms)** | **Tap (ms)** |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| `Start_Youtube` | `LEFT_GUI` + `1 F` + `LCTRL L` + `LS(LEFT_ALT) ENTER` + `Y T` + `ENTER`       | `START_ALL`    | 15            | 5            |
| `Start_Social`  | `LEFT_GUI` + `2 F` + `LS(LEFT_ALT) ENTER` + `D S` + `ENTER` + `LCTRL T` + `T G ENTER` + `LEFT_GUI A` + `LS(E L E M E N T ENTER)` | `START_SOCIAL` | 15            | 5            |

- **How to Use**: Triggered via the respective combo (e.g., YouTube combo runs `Start_Youtube`).
- **Purpose**: Opens YouTube or a social media app (e.g., Discord, Telegram) with a single combo press.

### Keymap Layout
Below is a textual representation of the base `letters` layer keymap:

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  TAB |  Q  |  W  |  E  |  R  |  T  |   |  Y  |  U  |  I  |  O  |  P  | BKSP |
| CTRL |  A  |  S  |  D  |  F  |  G  |   |  H  |  J  |  K  |  L  |  ;  |  '   |
| SHFT |  Z  |  X  |  C  |  V  |  B  |   |  N  |  M  |  ,  |  .  |  /  | ESC  |
           | GUI | LWR | SPC |   | ENT | RSE | ALT |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
- **LWR**: Switches to the numbers layer (`MO(1)`).
- **RSE**: Switches to the symbols layer (`MO(2)`).

### Notes
- The README assumes the user has basic familiarity with ZMK but provides enough detail for newcomers.
- Key positions (e.g., 7, 9, 4, 2) are based on the matrix defined in your `keymap` and may need adjustment if your keyboardâ€™s layout differs.
- The macros are interpreted as launching YouTube and social media apps (e.g., Discord, Telegram) based on the key sequences, but you can clarify their exact purpose if needed.
